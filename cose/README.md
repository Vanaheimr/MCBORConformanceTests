# Vanaheimr COSE (TypeScript)

**CBOR Object Signing and Encryption** ([RFC 9052](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9052))
in TypeScript, built on the CBOR codec of
[MetrologicalCBOR.TS](https://github.com/Vanaheimr/MetrologicalCBOR.TS) — the
counterpart of [Vanaheimr Styx](https://github.com/Vanaheimr/Styx)'s
[`Illias/COSE`](../libs/Styx/Styx/Illias/COSE/README.md), and the second
implementation the COSE cross-signing conformance suite needs in order to have
anything to compare.

Signing is what turns the [metrological value extension](https://github.com/OpenChargingTechnology/Whitepapers/blob/master/MetrologicalCBOR/README.md)
into something a third party can check: the encoding of a reading is a pure
function of its value, scale, unit, prefix and uncertainty, so the same reading
always produces the same bytes — and therefore the same signature. Two codecs
that disagree about one byte of one reading produce signatures that fail at the
other, which is a conformance failure worth catching before a meter ships.

## Why it lives here rather than in the data-format library

`@vanaheimr/metrological-cbor` has zero runtime dependencies and a documented
rule that it will never do cryptography: a data format that also carried a
crypto stack would be unusable as the leaf of somebody else's schema. That rule
is intact. This is a **separate package** with its own dependency
(`@noble/curves`), exactly as Styx keeps `Illias/COSE` beside `Illias/CBOR`
rather than inside it.

It is also deliberately extractable. [`src/cbor.ts`](src/cbor.ts) is the only
module that knows where the CBOR codec comes from, so moving this directory
into a repository of its own is a `git mv` and one import.

## What is implemented

- **`CoseSign1`** — a payload signed by a single signer (CBOR tag 18): sign,
  verify, detached payloads, external additional authenticated data, and the
  `crit` header parameter.
- **`CoseSign` / `CoseSignature`** — one payload, several signers (CBOR tag
  98). Each signature carries its own header buckets, so every party signs with
  its own algorithm and its own key.
- **Countersignatures** ([RFC 9338](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9338),
  header parameter 11) on a `CoseSign1` — a signature *of a signature*, in the
  version 2 form that actually covers the signature it countersigns.
- **`CoseKey`** — COSE keys of key type EC2 ([RFC 9052 §7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9052#section-7)),
  including compressed `y`, and COSE Key Thumbprints
  ([RFC 9679](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9679)).
- **The algorithm and curve registries**, including the fully-specified
  algorithms of [RFC 9864](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9864) and the
  brainpool curves registered by ISO/IEC 18013-5.

| Algorithm | Id | Curve | Digest |
|-----------|---:|-------|--------|
| `ES256` / `ES384` / `ES512` | −7 / −35 / −36 | any (deprecated by RFC 9864) | SHA-256 / 384 / 512 |
| `ESP256` / `ESP384` / `ESP512` | −9 / −51 / −52 | P-256 / P-384 / P-521 | SHA-256 / 384 / 512 |
| `ESB256` / `ESB320` / `ESB384` / `ESB512` | −265 / −266 / −267 / −268 | brainpoolP256r1 / P320r1 / P384r1 / P512r1 | SHA-256 / 384 / 384 / 512 |
| `ES256K` | −47 | secp256k1 | SHA-256 |

**brainpoolP320r1 is registered but not computable here**, because the
underlying curve library does not implement it. `ESB320` therefore parses, is
recognized and is refused at the point of use — the honest failure, where
silently substituting another curve would not be.

Not implemented: `COSE_Countersignature0`, EdDSA, MAC, encryption, and the
X.509 header parameters of [RFC 9360](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9360)
beyond carrying them — a chain that travels is read back unchanged, but nothing
here validates one against a trust anchor. Styx does; this does not, and a
`crit` that demands `x5chain` is consequently refused.

## Signing and verifying

```typescript
import { CoseAlgorithms, CoseCurves, CoseKey, CoseSign1 } from './src/index.ts';

const key      = CoseKey.fromPrivateScalar(CoseCurves.P256, privateScalar,
                                           { algorithm: CoseAlgorithms.ES256 });

const signed   = CoseSign1.sign(payload, key);
const bytes    = signed.toBytes();

const message  = CoseSign1.parse(bytes);
const result   = message.verify(key.publicKey());

if (!result.verified)
    console.log(result.reason);
```

A failed verification is not an exception — it is the expected outcome of
checking untrusted data — so it comes back as a result carrying the reason.
Malformed input, which is a different kind of wrong, throws `CoseError`.

Signing is **deterministic** ([RFC 6979](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6979)):
the nonce is derived from the private key and the message rather than drawn at
random. Signing the same data twice yields the same bytes, which makes a
published example recomputable — and it matters rather more for a device with
no dependable source of randomness, since a repeated nonce hands over the
private key.

Whenever the signing key does not live in this process, `toBeSigned()` hands
out exactly the byte string that has to be signed.

## Five things that are easy to get wrong

1. **The signature never covers the message.** It covers the `Sig_structure`
   `["Signature1", protected, external_aad, payload]` (RFC 9052 §4.4). The CBOR
   tag is therefore *not* signed: the same message with and without tag 18
   carries the very same signature bytes.
2. **The protected bucket is kept verbatim.** A re-serialization differing in a
   single byte — a non-preferred integer head, a different map order —
   invalidates every signature made over the original bytes. Nothing here
   re-encodes it, and the CBOR codec is driven in `preserve` mode throughout
   for the same reason.
3. **An empty protected bucket is `h''`, not `h'A0'`.** A zero-length byte
   string, not an encoded empty map, and the parser never "repairs" it.
4. **ECDSA signatures are `r ‖ s`, not DER**, each component zero-padded to the
   width of the group order (RFC 9053 §2.1) — 64 bytes on P-256, 132 on P-521.
   A DER signature produces an error message that says so.
5. **Low-S normalization is a policy, not a rule.** `@noble/curves` normalizes
   `s` by default; COSE does not, and RFC 6979 publishes the un-normalized
   values. Signing here passes `lowS: false` so that the bytes match the C#
   reference implementation, and verification passes it too so that a meter
   which signs without normalizing is not refused.

Key material has its own version of the same trap: coordinates and private keys
are fixed-width byte strings whose **leading zeroes must be preserved**
(RFC 9053 §7.1.1). A plain big-integer serialization shortens them roughly one
time in 256, and the resulting keys are rejected elsewhere. `CoseKey` always
pads, and checks the width whenever a key is actually used.

## Golden vectors

```bash
cd cose && npm install && npm test
```

The tests are pinned against the same published vectors the C# implementation
uses — same RFCs, same appendices, same transcription:

- **RFC 9052 C.2.1** — `COSE_Sign1`, including the external-AAD variant and the
  untagged form.
- **RFC 9052 C.1.1 / C.1.2** — `COSE_Sign` with one and with two signatures,
  the latter on P-256 and P-521 at once.
- **RFC 9338 A.2.1** — the countersignature the RFC prints in diagnostic
  notation only, assembled here from its documented parts. That both its body
  signature and its countersignature then verify is what proves the assembly.
- **RFC 6979 A.2.5** — the deterministic P-256 signatures, reproduced exactly.
- **The worked signed record of the specification** — 713 bytes produced by the
  C# implementation: the station's signature verifies *and is reproduced byte
  for byte*, both meter readings verify and are reproduced, the operator's
  countersignature verifies, the two metrological readings decode to the values
  the document prints, and all three key identifiers recompute as RFC 9679
  thumbprints.

ECDSA is randomized, so published signature bytes generally cannot be
reproduced by signing — but they can be *verified*, which is the stronger
statement: a single wrong byte anywhere in the `Sig_structure`, the header
buckets or the key would make the verification fail. Where the signer used
RFC 6979, reproduction is available too, and the tests take it.

## A note on German calibration law

COSE does not make a data format legally usable in the regulated part of the
charging infrastructure. That follows from the type approval of the measuring
instrument and from the data being checkable with the verification software the
conformity assessment covers — in practice OCMF or a signed meter format today,
not a free-form CBOR structure.

What this is for is the integrity of measurement data along the rest of the
chain, and for the conversation about what a digital, signed SI quantity should
look like.
