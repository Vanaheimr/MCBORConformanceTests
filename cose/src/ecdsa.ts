/**
 * The second and last seam: everything that computes a hash or touches a
 * private key lives here.
 *
 * Two things about ECDSA in COSE are easy to get wrong and both are settled in
 * this module.
 *
 * **The signature is `r ‖ s`, not DER.** Each component is zero-padded to the
 * width of the group order [RFC 9053, Section 2.1] — 64 bytes on P-256, 132 on
 * P-521. Most general-purpose signing APIs hand out DER by default, and a DER
 * signature in a COSE message fails verification everywhere with an error that
 * looks like a bad encoder.
 *
 * **Low-S normalization is a policy, not a rule.** Every ECDSA signature has a
 * valid twin `(r, n − s)`, and several libraries reject the second by default
 * under the anti-malleability convention Bitcoin established. COSE imposes no
 * such thing, and a meter that signs without normalizing produces perfectly
 * valid signatures that a low-S verifier refuses. Verification here therefore
 * passes `lowS: false`, which accepts both forms.
 *
 * Signing is deterministic (RFC 6979): the nonce is derived from the private
 * key and the message rather than drawn at random. That makes a published
 * example recomputable, and it matters rather more for a device with no
 * dependable source of randomness, where a repeated nonce hands over the
 * private key.

 *
 * The one curve of the COSE registry the underlying library does not ship —

 * published domain parameters. Nothing about that is exotic: a Weierstrass
 * curve *is* these seven numbers, and the library's own brainpool definitions
 * are written exactly this way.
 *
 * Transcribing 320-bit constants is the kind of task that fails silently, so
 * they are checked three times over: `weierstrass()` refuses a generator that
 * is not on the curve, `tests/brainpool.test.ts` checks that the order really
 * is the order, and the conformance suite signs with them and compares the
 * bytes against Bouncy Castle's own brainpoolP320r1. A single wrong digit
 * survives none of the three.
 *
 * SHA-384 goes with a 320-bit curve, which looks like a mistake and is what
 * RFC 9864 registers for `ESB320`. It matters twice over here: it is the
 * message digest, and it is the hash the RFC 6979 nonce is derived with.
