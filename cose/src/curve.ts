/**
 * The COSE elliptic curve registry [IANA, "COSE Elliptic Curves"].
 *
 * Two widths are recorded per curve and they are kept apart on purpose: the
 * *field* size is the width of a coordinate, the *order* size is the width of
 * a private key and of each half of an ECDSA signature. They coincide for
 * every curve in this registry, and they are still two different quantities —
 * a curve where they differ would silently produce keys other implementations
 * reject.
 *
 * P-521 is 66 bytes, not 64 and not 65. Its field is 521 bits wide, which is
 * 65 bytes and one bit.
