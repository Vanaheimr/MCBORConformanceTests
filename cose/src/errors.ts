 * What goes wrong, and the difference between the two kinds of wrong.
 *
 * A malformed message is a programming or transport error and throws. A
 * signature that does not verify is neither: it is the expected outcome of
 * checking untrusted data, and a library that throws for it invites the
 * `catch {}` that swallows the distinction. Verification therefore returns a
 * result that has to be looked at, and says why when the answer is no.
